      INGREDIENTS
      2 cups whole peeled tomatoes in their juice
      5 tablespoons butter
      1 onion, cut in half
      3/4 pound spaghetti
      1 medium potato, sliced thin
     
      DIRECTIONS
      In a heavy bottom saucepan, bring the tomatoes, butter and onion to a boil. 
	  Lower heat to a steady slow simmer and let sit uncovered for 45 minutes or until thick but still saucy.
      When the sauce is at its desired consistency, take it off the stove and let it cool for a few minutes. 
	  Using an immersion blender or any other kind of blender, blitz the tomato sauce until smooth and creamy.
      While the sauce is simmering, add the pasta to a pot of salted boiling water.
	  Cook until very al dente (the pasta will cook the rest of the way as it steeps in the sauce.)
	  Strain the pasta and toss in the sauce. Set aside.
      Coat the bottom of a deep nonstick skillet (or nonstick pot) with olive oil and lightly brown potato slices. 
	  Make sure you have enough slices to cover the bottom of the skillet. Lightly salt the potatoes and flip them over.
	  Add the pasta and sauce mixture on top of the potatoes, cover, and turn down to medium low.
      Let steep for 20 minutes, and turn down to low until ready to be served.
