       INGREDIENTS
        2 tablespoons butter
       1/2 cup onion, diced
       1 clove garlic, minced
       Salt and pepper to taste
       1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
       3 large ripe tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and chopped
       1 cup milk

      DIRECTIONS
      In a heavy skillet over medium heat, melt butter and saut√© onion until softened. 
	  Add garlic, salt, and pepper and cook for another minute.
	  (I start with about a 1/4 teaspoon of salt and maybe 3 turns of the peppermill.)
      Sprinkle the flour over and cook, stirring well for another couple minutes.
      Stir in the chopped tomato and cook for five more minutes. Slowly add the milk and bring to a simmer. 
	  Taste for seasoning, adjust. Serve warm with split buttermilk biscuits and a side of bacon.
