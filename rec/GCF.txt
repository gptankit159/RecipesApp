       READY IN: 20mins
       SERVES: 16

       INGREDIENTS
       2 (15 ounce) cans whole kernel corn
       4 eggs, slightly beaten
       4 tablespoons milk
       3 tablespoons butter, melted
       salt and pepper (optional)
       flour

      DIRECTIONS
      Combine corn, eggs, milk, butter, salt and pepper to taste, if using.
      Add flour gradually, just enough to hold mixture together.
      Amount of flour depends on size of eggs (and weather according to my grandma!).
      Heat 1/2 inch of oil in frying pan.
      Form patties whatever size you'd like, I do small ones so my kids can hold them.
      Fry in hot oil until golden brown.
      Serve as side dish OR if you left out the salt and pepper serve with syrup on the side.
      You can also dust with powdered sugar.
