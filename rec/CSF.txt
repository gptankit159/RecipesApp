     READY IN: 40mins
      SERVES: 4 side-dish servings

    INGREDIENTS
       3 ears of corn (shucked)
       1 large egg
       1/4 cup milk
       1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
       3 large shiitake mushrooms (2 ounces stems discarded and caps cut into 1/2-inch dice)
       1/4 cup diced sweet onion
       3/4 cup all-purpose flour
       1 teaspoon baking powder
       10 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
       1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper

        DIRECTIONS
        Step 1
        Cut the corn kernels from the cobs and transfer half of them to a blender. 
		Using the dull side of a knife, scrape the pulp from the cobs into the blender.
		Add the egg and milk; puree until smooth.
 
        Step 2
         In a very large nonstick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil.
		 Add the shiitake and onion and cook over high heat, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. 
		 Add the remaining corn and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. 
		 Scrape the mixture onto a plate and freeze just until no longer hot, about 5 minutes.

        Step 3
        In a bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, salt and pepper.
		Stir in the puree, then fold in the corn kernels, shiitake and onion.

        Step 4
        Wipe out the skillet and add the remaining 1/2 cup of oil. 
		When it is hot, add eight level 1/4-cup mounds of batter to the skillet and spread them to a 1/2-inch thickness.
		Fry over moderately high heat, turning once, until the fritters are golden and crusty, about 4 minutes. 
		Drain on paper towels and serve warm.
