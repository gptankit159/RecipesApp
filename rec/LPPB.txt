	   Cut the potatoes in half. 
	   Place the cleaned potatoes in a pan with a tight fitting lid, cover with water.
	   Add 1 teaspoon of salt to the water and bring to a boil, and cook potatoes until tender when tested with a fork.
	   Drain the potatoes in a colander. Keep them hot while you make the lemon pepper butter.
	   
       MAKE THE LEMON PEPPER BUTTER:
       Place the hot pan you used to boil the potatoes in back on the burner on medium low heat.
	   Add the butter, lemon pepper, garlic, lemon juice. 
	   Mix well, get it hot.
	   Then add the potatoes to the pan carefully, turning them over very gently to coat with the lemon pepper butter.
