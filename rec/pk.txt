      READY IN: 25mins
      SERVES: 4-6

      INGREDIENTS
      1 cup milk
      5 tablespoons butter
      1 cup flour
      2 eggs
      4 teaspoons baking powder
      1/4 teaspoon salt

      DIRECTIONS
      Warm the milk and butter until the butter is melted.
      Let cool a bit or it will cook the eggs when you add them.
      In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs until well-beaten.
     Add the cooled milk and butter and stir.
     Sprinkle the dry ingredients around on top of the wet ingredients, and stir them together. 
	 You don't want a big clump of baking powder/salt anywhere so just sprinkle them around instead of pouring them.
     If you want blueberry pancakes, sprinkle fresh or frozen blueberries on top before you turn them over.
